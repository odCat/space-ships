# space-ships

Video game in which two spaceships battle

This app is a recreation of a game I made a long time ago,
in primary school.

It is a tribute to my teachers and my pair programming colleague
at the time.

## TODO
* Find if threading can be added to the application. I don't think
Pascal support it natively
* Move the ships & graphic methods to a library
* Add screenshots to the README
