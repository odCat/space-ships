# Space Ships

_Space ships_ is a video game in which two spaceships battle.

### Why I wrote this program

This app is a recreation of a game I made a long time ago,
in primary school.

It is a tribute to my teachers, Mariana and Dragoș Kisch and
my pair programming colleague at the time, Dragoș.

### Screenshots

At this stage it might be difficult to compile the project
so I added some preview screenshots.

### TODO
- [ ] Find if threading can be added to the application. I don't think
Pascal support it natively
- [ ] Move the ships & graphic methods to a library
- [x] Add screenshots to the README
